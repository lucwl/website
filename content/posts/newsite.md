The third iteration of my personal website is here! For more information on my previous websites, read the [about](/about) section.

This time, I chose to build my website using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/). Having previously used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I was already fairly used to how SSGs work.

When it comes to building a website with Hugo, most people decide on using a community made theme. Themes in Hugo provide the structure and layout of the website, dictating what content is displayed and how it is organised.

For this website, I found the [Rusty Typewriter](https://github.com/math-queiroz/rusty-typewriter) theme to be the perfect fit.
It provides a comprehensive blogging and taxonomy system that would allows me to write and organise articles. I would like to thank [Matheus Queiroz](https://github.com/math-queiroz), the author of the theme, for his work.

There were a few remaining features that I wanted so I forked the repository and created my own variation of the theme, aptly named [Rusty Typewriter Better](https://github.com/lucwl/rusty-typewriter-better). I implemented improved blog SEO, links to social media, improved image and text formatting alongside other visual enhancements.

Overall, I am very happy with the end result.
