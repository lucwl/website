# About

This is the third iteration of my personal website. The full source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucwl/website).

## First iteration

The first iteration of my personal website was simply a school project to showcase my skills in vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

The design was interesting but overall the website did not provide a great deal of utility, not to mention the abhorrent light theme.

## Second iteration

The second iteration was once again built exclusively using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS. This time, the site has some cool functionality. The theme is also different, featuring the dark grey and orange colour scheme that I still maintain to this day.

Automatically refreshing GitHub stats and an advanced CSS scrolling animation. However, I soon realised that I would need a
more sophisticated personal website when I turned to blogging. A single page just would not do it any more.

## Third iteration

The website you're on right now!

This website was built with a modified version of the [Rusty TypeWriter](https://github.com/math-queiroz/rusty-typewriter) theme for the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/).

This website features a full on blogging system with neat features such as auto generating tables of contents and taxonomies.
